    "PyTorch comes with a nice paradigm for dealing with data which we'll use here. A PyTorch [`Dataset`](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/data.html#torch.utils.data.Dataset) knows where to find data in its raw form (files on disk) and how to load individual examples into Python datastructures. A PyTorch [`DataLoader`](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader) takes a dataset and offers a variety of ways to sample batches from that dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a moment to browse through the `CIFAR10` `Dataset` in `2_pytorch/cifar10.py`, read the `DataLoader` documentation linked above, and see how these are used in the section of `train.py` that loads data. Note that in the first part of the homework we subtracted a mean CIFAR10 image from every image before feeding it in to our models. Here we subtract a constant color instead. Both methods are seen in practice and work equally well.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch provides lots of vision datasets which can be imported directly from [`torchvision.datasets`](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/torchvision/datasets.html). Also see [`torchtext`](https://github.com/pytorch/text#datasets) for natural language datasets."

    "\n",
    "In PyTorch Deep Learning building blocks are implemented in the neural network module [`torch.nn`](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html#) (usually imported as `nn`). A PyTorch model is typically a subclass of [`nn.Module`](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) and thereby gains a multitude of features. Now implement a softmax classifier by filling in the marked sections of `models/softmax.py`. Because your logistic regressor is an `nn.Module` all of its parameters and sub-modules are accessible through the `.parameters()` and `.modules()` methods.\n",
