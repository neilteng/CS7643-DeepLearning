    "\n",
    "In this homework, we will do something slightly different. We will start from a convolutional neural network model which has been pretrained to perform image classification on the ImageNet dataset. We will use this model to define a loss function which quantifies our current unhappiness with our image, then use backpropagation to compute the gradient of this loss with respect to the pixels of the image. We will then keep the model fixed, and perform gradient descent *on the image* to synthesize a new image which minimizes the loss.\n",

    "2. **Fooling Images**: We can perturb an input image so that it appears the same to humans, but will be misclassified by the pretrained network.\n",
